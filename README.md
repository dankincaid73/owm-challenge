<strong>The Hourly Weather Tracker: An API Coding Exercise</strong>
 
The purpose of this exercise is to gain a better understanding of how you approach a more complicated problem. The exercise should take you 4 to 5 hours to complete. Documenting your design decision is a plus.
 
Exercise Instructions
o    Create an application that will track current weather measurements for a given set of zip codes
o    Store the following data at a minimum:
o    Zip code,
o    General weather conditions (e.g. sunny, rainy, etc),
o    Atmospheric pressure,
o    Temperature (in Fahrenheit),
o    Winds (direction and speed),
o    Humidity,
o    Timestamp (in UTC)
o    There is no output requirement for this application, it is data retrieval and storage only
o    The application should be able to recover from any errors encountered
o    The application should be developed using a TDD approach. 100% code coverage is not required
o     The set of zip codes and their respective retrieval frequency should be contained in configuration file
